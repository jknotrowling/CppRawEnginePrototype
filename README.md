# CppRawEnginePrototype
Just an Engine that uses the gdiplus.h. The average FPS are around 50 with 30 sprites. I know it is not the fastest Engine out there but it is really hardcoded.
I am thinking about calling it Hardcore Engine :)

Note:
Im 15 years old and still learning C++ so understand if this is not the best code you will ever see ;)
